  Each field has a type:
  Single-select, single value selected from a predefined list of options (e.g. Detection Method)Multi-select, as above but you can pick more than one option (e.g. Affected Teams)Text, freeform text field (e.g. Customer ID)Link, link URL that is synced to Slack bookmarks on the incident channel (e.g. External Status Page)Number, integer or fractional numbers (e.g. # Customers Affected)
  Single-select and multi-select fields can also be powered by the Catalog. This will mean a field has a

# incident_custom_field (Resource)

Manage custom fields.

Custom fields are used to attach metadata to incidents, which you can use when searching
for incidents in the dashboard, triggering workflows, building announcement rules or for
your own data needs.

Each field has a type:

- Single-select, single value selected from a predefined list of options (e.g. Detection Method)
- Multi-select, as above but you can pick more than one option (e.g. Affected Teams)
- Text, freeform text field (e.g. Customer ID)
- Link, link URL that is synced to Slack bookmarks on the incident channel (e.g. External Status Page)
- Number, integer or fractional numbers (e.g. # Customers Affected)

Single-select and multi-select fields can also be powered by the Catalog. This will mean a field has a
catalog_type_id, which links it to the catalog type that it references.

We may add more custom field types in the future - we'd love to hear any other types you'd like to use!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an Affected Teams multi-select field, required always, shown at all
# opportunities.
resource "incident_custom_field" "affected_teams" {
  name        = "Affected Teams"
  description = "The teams that are affected by this incident."
  field_type  = "multi_select"
}
```
