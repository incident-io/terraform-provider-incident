# incident_custom_field (Resource)

Manage custom fields.

Custom fields are used to attach metadata to incidents, which you can use when searching
for incidents in the dashboard, triggering workflows, building announcement rules or for
your own data needs.

Each field has a type:

- Single-select, single value selected from a predefined list of options (e.g. Detection Method)
- Multi-select, as above but you can pick more than one option (e.g. Affected Teams)
- Text, freeform text field (e.g. Customer ID)
- Link, link URL that is synced to Slack bookmarks on the incident channel (e.g. External Status Page)
- Number, integer or fractional numbers (e.g. # Customers Affected)

We may add more custom field types in the future - we'd love to hear any other types you'd like to use!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an Affected Teams multi-select field, required always, shown at all
# opportunities.
resource "incident_custom_field" "affected_teams" {
  name        = "Affected Teams"
  description = "The teams that are affected by this incident."
  field_type  = "multi_select"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Description of the custom field
- `field_type` (String) Type of custom field
- `name` (String) Human readable name for the custom field

### Optional

- `catalog_type_id` (String) For catalog fields, the ID of the associated catalog type
- `filter_by` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter_by))
- `group_by_catalog_attribute_id` (String) For catalog fields, the ID of the attribute used to group catalog entries (if applicable)
- `helptext_catalog_attribute_id` (String) Which catalog attribute provides helptext for the options

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the custom field

<a id="nestedatt--filter_by"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter_by`

Required:

- `catalog_attribute_id` (String) This must be an attribute of the catalog type of this custom field. It must be an attribute that points to another catalog type (so not a plain string, number, or boolean attribute).
- `custom_field_id` (String) This must be the ID of a custom field, which must have values of the same type as the attribute you are filtering by.

When this filtering field is set on an incident, the options for this custom field will be filtered to only those with the attribute value that matches the value of the filtering field.
