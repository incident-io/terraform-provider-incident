# incident_catalog_type (Resource)

Manage and browse catalog resources.

Use the incident.io catalog to track services, teams, product features and anything
else that helps build a map of your organisation. These different categories of thing
become catalog types, and each instance (like a particular service or team) is a
catalog entry.

Each type is made up of a series of attributes, and each attribute has a type. Types
can even have attributes that refer to other catalog types.

We automatically create catalog types when you connect an integration, such as GitHub 
repositories or PagerDuty services and teams. You can use this API to create custom
types, that are specifically tailored to your organisation.

Examples might be a 'Service' type with an 'Alert channel' which you can point at a 
Slack channel, or 'Team' which specifies its 'Manager' and 'Technical Lead' as Slack
users. You can then use these types to create powerful new workflows.

Consider using our official [catalog importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer).
It can be used to sync catalog data from sources like local files or GitHub and push 
them into the incident.io catalog without having to directly interact with our public API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a catalog type for a service tier, representing how important a service is.
resource "incident_catalog_type" "service_tier" {
  name            = "ServiceTier"
  description     = <<EOF
  How critical is this service, with tier 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest.
  EOF
  source_repo_url = "https://github.com/mycompany/infrastructure"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Human readble description of this type
- `name` (String) Name is the human readable name of this type

### Optional

- `source_repo_url` (String) The url of the external repository where this type is managed. When set, users will not be able to edit the catalog type (or its entries) via the UI, and will instead be provided a link to this URL.
- `type_name` (String) The type name of this catalog type, to be used when defining attributes. This is immutable once a CatalogType has been created. For non-externally sync types, it must follow the pattern Custom["SomeName "]

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of this catalog type
