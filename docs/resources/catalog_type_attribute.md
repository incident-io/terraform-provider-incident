  Manage and browse catalog resources.
  Use the incident.io catalog to track services, teams, product features and anything
  else that helps build a map of your organisation. These different categories of thing
  become catalog types, and each instance (like a particular service or team) is a
  catalog entry.
  Each type is made up of a series of attributes, and each attribute has a type. Types
  can even have attributes that refer to other catalog types.
  We automatically create catalog types when you connect an integration, such as GitHub
  repositories or PagerDuty services and teams. You can use this API to create custom
  types, that are specifically tailored to your organisation.
  Examples might be a 'Service' type with an 'Alert channel' which you can point at a
  Slack channel, or 'Team' which specifies its 'Manager' and 'Technical Lead' as Slack
  users. You can then use these types to create powerful new workflows.
