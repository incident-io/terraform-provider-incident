# incident_catalog_type_attribute (Resource)

Manage and browse catalog resources.

Use the incident.io catalog to track services, teams, product features and anything
else that helps build a map of your organisation. These different categories of thing
become catalog types, and each instance (like a particular service or team) is a
catalog entry.

Each type is made up of a series of attributes, and each attribute has a type. Types
can even have attributes that refer to other catalog types.

We automatically create catalog types when you connect an integration, such as GitHub
repositories or PagerDuty services and teams. You can use this API to create custom
types, that are specifically tailored to your organisation.

Examples might be a 'Service' type with an 'Alert channel' which you can point at a
Slack channel, or 'Team' which specifies its 'Manager' and 'Technical Lead' as Slack
users. You can then use these types to create powerful new workflows.

Consider using our official [catalog importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer).
It can be used to sync catalog data from sources like local files or GitHub and push
them into the incident.io catalog without having to directly interact with our public API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "incident_catalog_type" "service" {
  name        = "Service"
  description = "All services that we run across our product"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type" "service_tier" {
  name        = "Service Tier"
  description = "Level of importance for each service"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_description" {
  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service.id

  name = "Description"
  type = "Text"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_team" {
  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service.id

  name = "Team"
  type = "Text"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_service_tier" {
  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service.id
  name            = "Tier"
  type            = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.type_name
}

# To create a backlink (i.e. Service tier -> Services)
resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_tier_services" {
  catalog_type_id    = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.id
  name               = "Services"
  type               = incident_catalog_type.service.type_name
  backlink_attribute = incident_catalog_type_attribute.service_service_tier.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `catalog_type_id` (String) ID of this catalog type
- `name` (String) The name of this attribute.
- `type` (String) The type of this attribute.

### Optional

- `array` (Boolean) Whether this attribute is an array or scalar.
- `backlink_attribute` (String) If this is a backlink, the id of the attribute that it's linked from
- `path` (List of String) If this is a path attribute, the path that we should use to pull the data
- `schema_only` (Boolean) If true, Terraform will only manage the schema of the attribute. Values for this attribute can be managed from the incident.io web dashboard.

NOTE: When enabled, you should use the `managed_attributes` argument on either `incident_catalog_entry` or `incident_catalog_entries` to manage the values of other attributes on this type, without Terraform overwriting values set in the dashboard.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import a catalog type attribute using the format catalog_type_id:attribute_id
# Replace the IDs with real IDs from your incident.io organization
terraform import incident_catalog_type_attribute.example 01ABC123DEF456GHI789JKL:01MNO456PQR789STU012VWX
```
