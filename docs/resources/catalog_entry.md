# incident_catalog_entry (Resource)

This resource manages a single entry for a given catalog type. It should be used when
you're loading a small number (<100) of catalog entries and want to do so with a Terraform
for_each, or you don't want terraform to remove any entries that it is not managing.

If you're working with a large number of entries (>100) or want to be authoritative
(remove anything Terraform does not manage) then prefer `incident_catalog_entries`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  service_tiers = [
    {
      name        = "tier_1"
      description = "Critical customer-facing services"
      external_id = "service-tier-1"
    },
    {
      name        = "tier_2"
      description = "Either customers or internal user processes are impacted if this service fails"
      external_id = "service-tier-2"
    },
    {
      name        = "tier_3"
      description = "Non-essential services"
      external_id = "service-tier-3"
    },
  ]
}

resource "incident_catalog_type" "service_tier" {
  name        = "Service Tier"
  description = "Level of importance for each service"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_tier_description" {
  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.id

  name = "Description"
  type = "Text"
}

resource "incident_catalog_entry" "service_tier" {
  for_each = { for tier in local.service_tiers :
    tier.name => tier
  }

  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.id

  name = each.value.name

  external_id = each.value.external_id

  attribute_values = [
    {
      attribute = incident_catalog_type_attribute.service_tier_description.id,
      value     = each.value.description,
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `attribute_values` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--attribute_values))
- `catalog_type_id` (String) ID of this catalog type
- `name` (String) Name is the human readable name of this entry

### Optional

- `aliases` (List of String) Optional aliases that can be used to reference this entry
- `external_id` (String) An optional alternative ID for this entry, which is ensured to be unique for the type
- `managed_attributes` (Set of String) The set of attributes that are managed by this resource. By default, all attributes are managed by this resource.

This can be used to allow other attributes of a catalog entry to be managed elsewhere, for example in another Terraform repository or the incident.io web UI.
- `rank` (Number) When catalog type is ranked, this is used to help order things

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of this catalog entry

<a id="nestedatt--attribute_values"></a>
### Nested Schema for `attribute_values`

Required:

- `attribute` (String) The ID of this attribute, usually loaded from the incident_catalog_type_attribute resource.

Optional:

- `array_value` (List of String) The value of this element of the array, in a format suitable for this attribute type.
- `value` (String) The value of this attribute, in a format suitable for this attribute type.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import a catalog entry using its ID
# Replace the ID with a real ID from your incident.io organization
terraform import incident_catalog_entry.example 01ABC123DEF456GHI789JKL
```
