Use the incident.io catalog to track services, teams, product features and anything
else that helps build a map of your organisation.

The catalog has a number of types which are synced from your connected integrations, such
as GitHub Repositories or PagerDuty Services, but you can also create custom types
specifically tailored to your company.

Examples might be a Service type with an Alert channel which you can point at a Slack
channel, or Team which specifies its Manager and Technical Lead.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "incident_catalog_type" "service_tier" {
  name        = "Service Tier"
  description = "Level of importance for each service"
}

resource "incident_catalog_type_attribute" "service_tier_description" {
  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.id

  name = "Description"
  type = "Text"
}

resource "incident_catalog_entry" "service_tier" {
  for_each = {
    for name, tier in [
      {
        name        = "tier_1"
        description = "Critical customer-facing services"
      },
      {
        name        = "tier_2"
        description = "Either customers or internal user processes are impacted if this service fails"
      },
      {
        name        = "tier_3"
        description = "Non-essential services"
      },
    ] : tier.name => tier
  }

  catalog_type_id = incident_catalog_type.service_tier.id

  name = each.value.name

  attribute_values = [
    {
      attribute = incident_catalog_type_attribute.service_tier_description.id,
      value     = each.value.description,
    },
  ]
}
