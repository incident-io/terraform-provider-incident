## Schema

### Optional

- `categories` (List of String) The categories that this type belongs to, to be shown in the web dashboard. Possible values are: `customer`, `issue-tracker`, `product-feature`, `service`, `on-call`, `team`, `user`.
- `name` (String) Name is the human readable name of this type
- `type_name` (String) The type name of this catalog type, to be used when defining attributes. This is immutable once a CatalogType has been created. For non-externally sync types, it must follow the pattern Custom["SomeName "]

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) Human readble description of this type
- `id` (String) ID of this catalog type
- `source_repo_url` (String) The url of the external repository where this type is managed. When set, users will not be able to edit the catalog type (or its entries) via the UI, and will instead be provided a link to this URL.
