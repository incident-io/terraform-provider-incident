<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Human readable name for the custom field

### Read-Only

- `catalog_type_id` (String) For catalog fields, the ID of the associated catalog type
- `description` (String) Description of the custom field
- `field_type` (String) Type of custom field
- `filter_by` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter_by))
- `group_by_catalog_attribute_id` (String) For catalog fields, the ID of the attribute used to group catalog entries (if applicable)
- `helptext_catalog_attribute_id` (String) Which catalog attribute provides helptext for the options
- `id` (String) The custom field ID

<a id="nestedatt--filter_by"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter_by`

Read-Only:

- `catalog_attribute_id` (String) This must be an attribute of the catalog type of this custom field. It must be an attribute that points to another catalog type (so not a plain string, number, or boolean attribute).
- `custom_field_id` (String) This must be the ID of a custom field, which must have values of the same type as the attribute you are filtering by.

When this filtering field is set on an incident, the options for this custom field will be filtered to only those with the attribute value that matches the value of the filtering field.
